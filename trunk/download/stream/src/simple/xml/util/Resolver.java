/**
 * This is used to store <code>Match</code> objects, which can then be
 * retrieved using a string by comparing that string to the pattern of
 * the <code>Match</code> objects. Patterns consist of characters
 * with either the '*' or '?' characters as wild characters. The '*'
 * character is completely wild meaning that is will match nothing or
 * a long sequence of characters. The '?' character matches a single
 * character.
 * <p>
 * If the '?' character immediately follows the '*' character then the
 * match is made as any sequence of characters up to the first match 
 * of the next character. For example "/*?/index.jsp" will match all 
 * files preceeded by only a single path. So "/pub/index.jsp" will
 * match, however "/pub/bin/index.jsp" will not, as it has two paths.
 * So, in effect the '*?' sequence will match anything or nothing up
 * to the first occurence of the next character in the pattern.
 * <p>
 * A design goal of the <code>Resolver</code> was to make it capable
 * of  high performance. In order to achieve a high performance the 
 * <code>Resolver</code> can cache the resolutions it makes so that if
 * the same text is given to the <code>Resolver.resolve</code> method 
 * a cached result can be retrived quickly which will decrease the 
 * length of time and work required to perform the match.
 * <p>
 * The semantics of the resolver are such that the last pattern added
 * with a wild string is the first one checked for a match. This means
 * that if a sequence of insertions like <code>add(x)</code> followed
 * by <code>add(y)</code> is made, then a <code>resolve(z)</code> will
 * result in a comparison to y first and then x, if z matches y then 
 * it is given as the result and if z does not match y and matches x 
 * then x is returned, remember if z matches both x and y then y will 
 * be the result due to the fact that is was the last pattern added.
