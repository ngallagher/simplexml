/**
 * The <code>Dictionary</code> object represents a mapped set of entry
 * objects that can be serialized and deserialized. This is used when
 * there is a need to load a list of objects that can be mapped using 
 * a name attribute. Using this object avoids the need to implement a
 * commonly required pattern of building a map of XML element objects.
 * <pre>
 *
 *    &lt;dictionary&gt;
 *       &lt;entry name="example"&gt;
 *          &lt;element&gt;example text&lt;/element&gt;
 *       &lt;/entry&gt;
 *       &lt;entry name="example"&gt;
 *          &lt;element&gt;example text&lt;/element&gt;
 *       &lt;/entry&gt;       
 *    &lt;/dictionary&gt;
 * 
 * </pre>
 * This can contain implementations of the <code>Entry</code> object 
 * which contains a required "name" attribute. Implementations of the
 * entry object can add further XML attributes an elements. This must
 * be annotated with the <code>ElementList</code> annotation in order
 * to be serialized and deserialized as an object field.
