/**
 * The <code>Text</code> annotation is used to represent a field 
 * that appears as text within an XML element. Fields annotated with
 * this must be primitive values. A restriction on this annotation
 * is that it can only appear once within a schema class, and it 
 * can not appear with the <code>Element</code> annotation.
 * <pre>

 *    &lt;example one="value" two="value&gt;
 *       Example text value

 * Text values are used when an element containing attributes is
 * used to wrap a text value with no child elements. This can be
 * used in place of an element annotation to represent a primitive
 * which is wrapped in a surrounding XML element.
