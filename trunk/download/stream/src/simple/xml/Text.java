/**
 * The <code>Text</code> annotation is used to represent a field or
 * method that appears as text within an XML element. Methods and
 * fields annotated with this must represent primitive values. One
 * restriction on this annotation is that it can only appear once 
 * within a schema class, and it can not appear with the another XML
 * element annotations, such as the <code>Element</code> annotation. 
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &lt;example one="value" two="value"&gt;
 *       Example text value       
 *    &lt;example&gt;
 * 
 * </pre>
 * Text values are used when an element containing attributes is
 * used to wrap a text value with no child elements. This can be
 * used in place of an element annotation to represent a primitive
 * which is wrapped in a surrounding XML element.
