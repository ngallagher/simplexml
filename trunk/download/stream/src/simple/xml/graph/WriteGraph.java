/**
 * The <code>WriteGraph</code> object is used to build the graph that
 * is used to represent the serialized object and its references. The
 * graph is stored in an <code>IdentityHashMap</code> which will 
 * store the objects in such a way that this graph object can tell if
 * it has allready been written to the XML document. If an object has
 * already been written to the XML document an reference attribute
 * is added to the element representing the object and serialization
 * of that object is complete, that is, no more elements are written.
 * <p>
 * The attribute values written by this are unique strings, which 
 * allows the deserialization process to identify object references
 * easily. By default these references are incrementing integers 
 * however for deserialization they can be any unique string value.
