/**
 * The <code>CycleStrategy</code> represents a strategy that is used
 * to augment the deserialization and serialization process such that
 * cycles in an object graph can be supported. This adds additional 
 * attributes to the serializaed XML elements so that during the 
 * deserialization process an objects cycles can be created. Without
 * the use of a strategy such as this, cycles could cause an infinite
 * loop during the serialization process while traversing the graph.
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &lt;root id="1"&gt;
 *       &lt;object id="2"&gt;
 *          &lt;object id="3" name="name"&gt;Example&lt;/item&gt;
 *          &lt;object reference="2"/&gt;
 *       &lt;/object&gt;
 *    &lt;/root&gt;
 * 
 * </pre>
 * In the above serialized XML there is a circular reference, where
 * the XML element with id "2" contains a reference to itself. In
 * most data binding frameworks this will cause an infinite loop, 
 * or in some cases will just fail to represent the references well.
 * With this strategy you can ensure that cycles in complex object
 * graphs will be maintained and can be serialized safely.
