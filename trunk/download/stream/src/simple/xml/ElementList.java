/**
 * The <code>ElementList</code> annotation represents a field that is
 * a list of elements stored in a <code>Collection</code> object. The
 * collection object deserialized is typically of the same type as
 * the field. However, a <code>class</code> attribute can be used to
 * override the field type, however the type must be assignable.
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &lt;list class="demo.ExampleList"&gt;

 *       &lt;element name="two"/&gt;

 *    &lt;/list&gt;
 * 
 * </pre>
 * If a <code>class</code> attribute is not provided and the type of
 * the field is abstract, a suitable match is searched for from the
 * collections available from the Java collections framework.
