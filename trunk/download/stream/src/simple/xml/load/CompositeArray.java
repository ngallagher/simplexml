/**
 * The <code>CompositeArray</code> object is used to convert a list of
 * elements to an array of object entries. This in effect performs a 
 * root serialization and deserialization of entry elements for the
 * array object. On serialization each objects type must be checked 
 * against the array component type so that it is serialized in a form 
 * that can be deserialized dynamically. 
 * <pre>
 *
 *    &lt;array&gt;
 *       &lt;entry attribute="value"&gt;
 *          &lt;text&gt;example text value&lt;/text&gt;
 *       &lt;/entry&gt;
 *       &lt;entry attribute="demo"&gt;
 *          &lt;text&gt;some other example&lt;/text/&gt;
 *       &lt;/entry&gt;
 *    &lt;/array&gt;
 * 
 * </pre>
 * For the above XML element list the element <code>entry</code> is
 * contained within the array. Each entry element is deserialized as 
 * a root element and then inserted into the array. For serialization 
 * the reverse is done, each element taken from the array is written
 * as a root element to the parent element to create the list. Entry
 * objects do not need to be of the same type.
