/**
 * The <code>Composite</code> object is used to perform serialization
 * of objects that contain XML annotation. Composite objects are objects
 * that are not primitive and contain references to serializable fields.
 * This <code>Converter</code> will visit each field within the object
 * and deserialize or serialize that field depending on the requested
 * action. If a required field is not present when deserializing from
 * an XML element this terminates the deserialization reports the error.
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &lt;element name="test" class="some.package.Type"&gt;
 *       &lt;text&gt;string value&lt;/text&gt;
 *       &lt;integer&gt;1234&lt;/integer&gt;
 *    &lt;/element&gt;
 * 
 * </pre>
 * To deserialize the above XML source this will attempt to match the
 * attribute name with an <code>Attribute</code> annotation from the
 * XML schema class, which is specified as "some.package.Type". This
 * type must also contain <code>Element</code> annotations for the
 * "text" and "integer" elements.
 * <p>
 * Serialization requires that all fields marked as required must have
 * values that are not null. This ensures that the serialized object
 * can be deserialized at a later stage using the same class schema.
 * If a required field is null the serialization terminates an an
 * exception is thrown.
