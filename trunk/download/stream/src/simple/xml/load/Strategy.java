/**
 * The <code>Strategy</code> interface represents a strategy that can be 
 * used to resolve and load the <code>Class</code> objects that compose 
 * a serializable object. A strategy implementation will make use of the
 * provided attribute node map to extract details that can be used to
 * determine what type of object must be used. 
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &lt;xml version="1.0"&gt;
 *    &lt;example class="some.example.Type"&gt;
 *       &lt;integer&gt;2&lt;/integer&gt;
 *    &lt;/example&gt;
 *    
 * </pre> 
 * The above example shows how the default strategy augments elements
 * with "class" attributes that describe the type that should be used
 * to instantiate a field when an object is deserialized. So looking at
 * the above example the root element would be a "some.example.Type".
 * <p>
 * Custom <code>Strategy</code> implementations give the persister a
 * chance to intercept the class loading and type resolution for XML
 * documents. It also opens up the possibility for class versioning.
 * To establish contextual information a <code>Map</code> object can be
 * used. The map object is a transient object that is created and used
 * for the duration of a single operation of the persister.
