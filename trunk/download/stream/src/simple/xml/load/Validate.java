/**
 * The <code>Validate</code> annotation is used to mark a method in
 * a serializable object that requires a callback from the persister
 * once the deserialization completes. The validate method is invoked
 * by the <code>Persister</code> after all fields have been assigned
 * and before the commit method is invoked.
 * <p>
 * Typically the validate method is used to validate the fields that
 * have been assigned once deserialization has been completed. The
 * validate method must be a no argument public method or a method
 * that takes a <code>Map</code> as the only argument. When invoked 
 * the object can determine whether the fields are valid, if the  
 * field values do not conform to the objects requirements then the
 * method can throw an exception to terminate deserialization.
