/**
 * The <code>ElementArray</code> annotation represents a method or 
 * field that is an array of elements. The array deserialized is the
 * same type as the field or method, all entries within the array 
 * must be a compatible type. However, a <code>class</code> attribute 
 * can be used to override an entry, this must be an assignable type.
 * <pre>
 *
 *    &lt;array length="2"&gt;
 *       &lt;entry&gt;
 *          &lt;value&gt;example text value&lt;/value&gt;
 *       &lt;/entry&gt;
 *       &lt;entry&gt;
 *          &lt;value&gt;some other value&lt;/value&gt;
 *       &lt;/entry&gt;
 *       &lt;entry/&gt;
 *    &lt;/array&gt;
 * 
 * </pre>
 * All null objects within the array are represented as an empty XML
 * element so that they can be deserialized accurately. This ensures
 * that the length attribute of the array is respected, as well as 
 * the index position of all serialized entries. The length of the 
 * array must be specified for deserialization to instantiate the 
 * array before the array values are instantiated. This is required 
 * to account for cyclical references in the object graph.
