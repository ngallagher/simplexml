/**
 * Provides a core set of strategies that can be used for serialization.
 * Stragtegies tell the serialization process what to do when it reads
 * or writes an XML element. A strategy should contain all information
 * required to serialize and deserialize an object instance. By default 
 * the <code>TreeStrategy</code> is used by the serialization process.
