 * The <code>Scanner</code> object performs the reflective inspection
 * of a class and builds a map of attributes and elements for each
 * annotated field. This acts as a cachable container for reflection
 * actions performed on a specific type. When scanning the provided
 * class this inserts the scanned field as a <code>Label</code> in to
 * a map so that it can be retrieved by name. Annotations classified
 * as attributes have the <code>Attribute</code> annotation, all other
 * annotated fields are stored as elements.
