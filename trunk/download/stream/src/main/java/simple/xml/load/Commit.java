/**
 * The <code>Commit</code> annotation is used to mark a method within
 * a serializable object that requires a callback from the persister
 * once the deserialization completes. The commit method is invoked
 * by the <code>Persister</code> after all fields have been assigned
 * and after the validation method has been invoked, if the object
 * has a method marked with the <code>Validate</code> annotation.
 * <p>
 * Typically the commit method is used to complete deserialization
 * by allowing the object to build further data structures from the
 * fields that have been created from the deserialization process.
 * The commit method must be a no argument method or a method that
 * takes a single <code>Map</code> object argument, and may throw an
 * exception, in which case the deserialization process terminates.
