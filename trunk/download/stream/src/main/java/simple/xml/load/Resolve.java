/**
 * The <code>Resolve</code> method is used to resolve an object that
 * has been deserialized from the XML document. This is used when the
 * deserialized object whats to provide a substitute to itself within
 * the object graph. This is particularly useful when an object is
 * used to reference an external XML document, as it allows that XML
 * document to be deserialized in to a new object instance.
 * <p>
 * This is similar to the <code>readResolve</code> method used within
 * Java Object Serialization in that it is used to create a object to 
 * plug in to the object graph after it has been fully deserialized.
 * Care should be taken when using this annotation as the object that
 * is returned from the resolve method must match the field type such
 * that the resolved object is an assignable substitute.
