/**
 * The <code>Source</code> object acts as a contextual object that is

 * <p>
 * For serialization the source object is required as a factory for
 * <code>Schema</code> objects, which are used to visit each field 
 * in the class that can be serialized. Also this can be used to get
 * any data entered into the session <code>Map</code> object.
 * <p>
 * When deserializing the source object provides the contextual data
 * used to replace template variables extracted from the XML source.
 * This is performed using the <code>Filter</code> object. Also, as 
 * in serialization it acts as a factory for the <code>Schema</code> 
 * objects used to examine the serializable fields of an object.
