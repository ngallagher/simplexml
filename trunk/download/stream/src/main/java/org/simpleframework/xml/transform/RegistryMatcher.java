 * The <code>RegistryMatcher</code> provides a simple matcher backed
 * by a registry. Registration can be done to match a class to a
 * <code>Transform</code> class or instance. If a transform class is
 * registered an instance of it is created when requested using the
 * default no argument constructor of the type, it is then cached so 
 * it can be reused on future requests. When an instance is registered
 * it is reused on each request.
