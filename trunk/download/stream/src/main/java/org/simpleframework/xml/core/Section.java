 * that it can contain other sections. Each section contains the
 * elements and attributes associated with it. This is used so that
 * complex XML structures can be written for a single object.
 * <p>
 * For convenience all the element names, including other section
 * names, can be iterated over. Element and section names can be
 * differentiated using the source section.
