/**
 * The <code>ElementListUnion</code> annotation is used to describe 
 * fields and methods that can dynamically match a schema class. Each 
 * union can have a number of different XML class schemas matched based 
 * on an XML element name or the instance type. Here a collection of
 * element list annotations can be declared. Each annotation expresses
 * the types the list can accept. Taking the declaration below, if the
 * annotation is inline, the list can take a number of varying types
 * all determined from the XML element name.
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &#64;ElementListUnion({
 *       &#64;ElementList(entry="x", inline=true, type=X.class),
 *       &#64;ElementList(entry="y", inline=true, type=Y.class),
 *       &#64;ElementList(entry="z", inline=true, type=Z.class)               
 *    })
 *    private List&lt;Code&gt; codes;
 *    
 * </pre>
 * For the above definition the list field can take any of the declared
 * types. On deserialization the name of the element will determine the
 * type that is instantiated and inserted in to the list. When the list
 * is serialized the list entry instance type will determine the name 
 * of the element the instance will serialized as. This provides a 
 * useful means of consume more complicated sources.
