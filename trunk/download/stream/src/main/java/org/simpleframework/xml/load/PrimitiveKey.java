/**
 * The <code>PrimitiveKey</code> is used to serialize a primitive key 
 * to and from a node. If a key name is provided in the annotation 
 * then this will serialize and deserialize that key with the given
 * name, if the key is an attribute, then it is written using the 
 * provided name. 
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &lt;entry key="one"&gt;example one&lt;/entry&gt;
 *    &lt;entry key="two"&gt;example two&lt;/entry&gt;
 *    &lt;entry key="three"&gt;example three&lt;/entry&gt;    
 * 
 * </pre>
 * Allowing the key to be written as either an XML attribute or an
 * element enables a more flexible means for representing the key.
 * Composite elements can not be used as attribute values as they do 
 * not serialize to a string. Primitive keys as elements can be
 * maintained as references using the cycle strategy.
