/**
 * The <code>VariantMap</code> annotation is used to describe a field 
 * or method that can have a number of different XML schemas depending
 * on an XML element name of the instance type. Here a map of element 
 * map annotations can be declared. Each annotation expresses the types
 * the map can accept. Taking the declaration below, if the annotation 
 * is inline, the map can take a number of varying types all determined
 * from the XML element name.
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &#64;VariantMap({
 *       &#64;ElementMap(entry="x", inline=true, valueType=X.class),
 *       &#64;ElementMap(entry="y", inline=true, valueType=Y.class),
 *       &#64;ElementMap(entry="z", inline=true, valueType=Z.class)               
 *    })
 *    private Map<String, Code> codes;
 *    
 * </pre>
 * For the above definition the map field can take any of the declared
 * types. On deserialization the name of the element will determine the
 * type that is instantiated and inserted in to the map. When the map
 * is serialized the list entry instance type will determine the name 
 * of the element the instance will serialized as. This provides a 
 * useful means of consume more complicated sources.
