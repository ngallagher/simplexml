/**
 * The <code>Namespace</code> annotation is used to set a namespace
 * on an element or attribute. By annotating a method, field or 
 * class with this annotation that entity assumes the XML namespace
 * provided. When used on a class the annotation describes the
 * namespace that should be used, this however can be overridden by
 * an annotated field or method declaration of that type.
 * <pre>
 *  
 *    &lt;book:book xmlns:book="http://www.example.com/book"&gt;
 *       &lt;book:author&gt;saurabh&lt;/book:author&gt;
 *       &lt;book:title&gt;example title&lt;/book:title&gt;
 *       &lt;book:isbn&gt;ISB-16728-10&lt;/book:isbn&gt;
 *    &lt;/book:book&gt;
 *
 * </pre>
 * In the above XML snippet a namespace has been declared with the
 * prefix "book" and the reference "http://www.example.com/book". If
 * such a namespace is applied to a class, method, or field then 
 * each of the attributes an elements, which does not have an 
 * explicit override then they inherit their parents prefix. 
 * <pre>
 *
 *    &lt;root:example xmlns:root="http://www.example.com/root"&gt;
 *       &lt;child xmlns=""&gt;
 *          &lt;anonymous&gt;anonymous element&lt;/anonymous&gt;
 *       &lt;/child&gt;
 *    &lt;/root:example&gt;
 *
 * </pre>
 * In order to override the parent namespace an anonymous namespace
 * can be declared. This overrides the parents scope with no default
 * namespace tied to the child elements which is declared within a
 * given namespace.
