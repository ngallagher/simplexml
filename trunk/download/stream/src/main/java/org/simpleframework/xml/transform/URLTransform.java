 * value must be readable and writable in the same format. Fields
 * and methods annotated with the XML attribute annotation will use
 * this to persist and retrieve the value to and from the XML source.

 * Aside from the obvious difference, the element annotation has an
 * advantage over the attribute annotation in that it can maintain
 * any references using the <code>CycleStrategy</code> object.
