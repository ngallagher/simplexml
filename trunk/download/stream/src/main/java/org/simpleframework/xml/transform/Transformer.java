/**
 * The <code>Transformer</code> object is used to convert strings to
 * and from object instances. This is used during the serialization
 * and deserialization process to transform types from the Java class
 * libraries, as well as other types which do not contain XML schema
 * annotations. Typically this will be used to transform primitive
 * types to and from strings, such as <code>int</code> values.
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &#64;Element
 *    private String[] value;
 *    
 * </pre>
 * For example taking the above value the array of strings needs to 
 * be converted in to a single string value that can be inserted in 
 * to the element in such a way that in can be read later. In this
 * case the serialized value of the string array would be as follows.
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &lt;value&gt;one, two, three&lt;/value&gt;
 * 
 * </pre>
 * Here each non-null string is inserted in to a comma separated  
 * list of values, which can later be deserialized. Just to note the
 * above array could be annotated with <code>ElementList</code> just
 * as easily, in which case each entry would have its own element.
 * The choice of which annotation to use is up to the developer. A
 * more obvious benefit to transformations like this can be seen for
 * values annotated with the <code>Attribute</code> annotation.
