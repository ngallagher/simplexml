 * like structure in that it can contain other models as well as XML
 * attributes and elements. Each model represents a context within an
 * XML document, each context is navigated to with an XPath expression.
 * <p>
 * The model is responsible for building the element and attribute
 * labels used to read and write and also to ensure the correct order
 * of the XML elements and attributes is enforced. Once the model has
 * been completed it can then be validated to ensure its contents 
 * represent a valid XML structure.
