/**
 * The <code>Complete</code> annotation is used to mark a method that
 * requires a callback from the persister once the serialization of
 * the object has completed. The complete method is typically used
 * in combination with the persist method, which is the method that
 * is annotated with the <code>Persist</code> annotation.
 * <p>
 * Typically the complete method will revert any changes made when 
 * the persist method was invoked. For example, should the persist
 * method acquire a lock to ensure the object is serialized in a
 * safe state then the commit method can be used to release the lock.
 * The complete method must be a no argument public method or a
 * method that takes a single <code>Map</code> object argument. The
 * complete method is invoked even if deserialization terminates.
