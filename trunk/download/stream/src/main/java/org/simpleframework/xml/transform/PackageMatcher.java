 * The <code>PackageMatcher</code> object is used to perform matches
 * based on the package type of the object to be transformed. This
 * acts as a convention over configuration means of mapping a type
 * to a transform without statically mapping the types to respective
 * transform implementations. 
 * <p>
 * There are two forms of transformation matching peformed by this
 * object. Matching can be done for array types and for object types.
 * For an array the transform will have "ArrayTransform" appended to
 * the end of the fully qualified class name, for a normal type the
 * "Transform" string is appended.
