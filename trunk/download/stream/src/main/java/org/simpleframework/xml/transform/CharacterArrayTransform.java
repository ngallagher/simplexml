/**
 * The <code>CharacterArrayTransform</code> is used to transform text
 * values to and from string representations, which will be inserted
 * in the generated XML document as the value place holder. The
 * value must be readable and writable in the same format. Fields
 * and methods annotated with the XML attribute annotation will use
 * this to persist and retrieve the value to and from the XML source.
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &#64;Attribute
 *    private char[] text;
 *    
 * </pre>
 * As well as the XML attribute values using transforms, fields and
 * methods annotated with the XML element annotation will use this.
 * Aside from the obvious difference, the element annotation has an
 * advantage over the attribute annotation in that it can maintain
 * any references using the <code>CycleStrategy</code> object.
