/**
 * The <code>PrimitiveValue</code> is used to serialize a primitive 
 * value to and from a node. If a value name is provided in the 
 * annotation then this will serialize and deserialize that value 
 * with the given name, if the value is primitive and no name is
 * specified then the value is written inline, that is without any
 * enclosing XML element.
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &lt;entry key="one"&gt;example one&lt;/entry&gt;
 *    &lt;entry key="two"&gt;example two&lt;/entry&gt;
 *    &lt;entry key="three"&gt;example three&lt;/entry&gt;    
 * 
 * </pre>
 * Allowing the value to be written as either an XML element or an
 * inline text value enables a more flexible means for representing 
 * the value. The only condition for having an inline value is that
 * the key is specified as an attribute in the annotation.
