/**
 * The <code>RegistryStrategy</code> object is used to intercept
 * the serialization process and delegate to custom converters. The
 * custom converters are resolved from a <code>Registry</code>
 * object, which is provided to the constructor. If there is no
 * binding for a particular object then serialization is delegated
 * to an internal strategy. All converters resolved by this are
 * instantiated once and cached internally for performance.
 * <p>
 * By default the <code>TreeStrategy</code> is used to perform the
 * normal serialization process should there be no class binding
 * specifying a converter to use. However, any implementation can
 * be used, including the <code>CycleStrategy</code>, which handles
 * cycles in the object graph. To specify the internal strategy to
 * use it can be provided in the constructor.
