/**
 * The <code>MethodScanner</code> object is used to scan an object 
 * for matching get and set methods for an XML annotation. This will
 * scan for annotated methods starting with the most specialized
 * class up the class hierarchy. Thus, annotated methods can be 
 * overridden in a type specialization.
 * <p>
 * The annotated methods must be either a getter or setter method
 * following the Java Beans naming conventions. This convention is
 * such that a method must begin with "get", "set", or "is". A pair
 * of set and get methods for an annotation must make use of the
 * same type. For instance if the return type for the get method
 * was <code>String</code> then the set method must have a single
 * argument parameter that takes a <code>String</code> type.
 * <p>
 * For a method to be considered there must be both the get and set
 * methods. If either method is missing then the scanner fails with
 * an exception. Also, if an annotation marks a method which does
 * not follow Java Bean naming conventions an exception is thrown.
