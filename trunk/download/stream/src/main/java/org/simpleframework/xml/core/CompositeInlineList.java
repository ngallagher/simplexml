/**
 * The <code>CompositeInlineList</code> object is used to convert an 
 * group of elements in to a collection of element entries. This is
 * used when a containing element for a list is not required. It 
 * extracts the elements by matching elements to name of the type
 * that the annotated field or method requires. This enables these
 * element entries to exist as siblings to other objects within the
 * object.  One restriction is that the <code>Root</code> annotation
 * for each of the types within the list must be the same.
 * <pre> 
 *    
 *    &lt;entry attribute="one"&gt;
 *       &lt;text&gt;example text value&lt;/text&gt;
 *    &lt;/entry&gt;
 *    &lt;entry attribute="two"&gt;
 *       &lt;text&gt;some other example&lt;/text&gt;
 *    &lt;/entry&gt;  
 *    &lt;entry attribute="three"&gt;
 *       &lt;text&gt;yet another example&lt;/text&gt;
 *    &lt;/entry&gt;      
 * 
 * </pre>
 * For the above XML element list the element <code>entry</code> is
 * contained within the list. Each entry element is thus deserialized
 * as a root element and then inserted into the list. This enables
 * lists to be composed from XML documents. For serialization the
 * reverse is done, each element taken from the collection is written
 * as a root element to the owning element to create the list. 
 * Entry objects do not need to be of the same type.
