/**
 * The <code>Persister</code> object is used to provide an implementation
 * of a serializer. This implements the <code>Serializer</code> interface
 * and enables objects to be persisted and loaded from various sources. 
 * This implementation makes use of <code>Filter</code> objects to
 * replace template variables within the source XML document. It is fully
 * thread safe and can be shared by multiple threads without concerns.
 * <p>
 * Deserialization is performed by passing an XML schema class into one
 * of the <code>read</code> methods along with the source of an XML stream.
 * The read method then reads the contents of the XML stream and builds
 * the object using annotations within the XML schema class.
 * <p>
 * Serialization is peformed by passing an object and an XML stream into
 * one of the <code>write</code> methods. The serialization process will
 * use the class of the provided object as the schema class. The object
 * is traversed and all fields are marshalled to the result stream.
