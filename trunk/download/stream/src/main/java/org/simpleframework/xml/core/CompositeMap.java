/**
 * The <code>CompositeMap</code> is used to serialize and deserialize
 * maps to and from a source XML document. The structure of the map in
 * the XML format is determined by the annotation. Keys can be either
 * attributes or elements, and values can be inline. This can perform
 * serialization and deserialization of the key and value objects 
 * whether the object types are primitive or composite.
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &lt;map&gt;
 *       &lt;entry key='1'&gt;           
 *          &lt;value&gt;one&lt;/value&gt;
 *       &lt;/entry&gt;
 *       &lt;entry key='2'&gt;
 *          &lt;value&gt;two&lt;/value&gt;
 *       &lt;/entry&gt;      
 *    &lt;/map&gt;
 *    
 * </pre>
 * For the above XML element map the element <code>entry</code> is 
 * used to wrap the key and value such that they can be grouped. This
 * element does not represent any real object. The names of each of
 * the XML elements serialized and deserialized can be configured.
