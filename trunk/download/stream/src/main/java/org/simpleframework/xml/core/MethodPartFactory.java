/**
 * The <code>MethodPartFactory</code> is used to create method parts
 * based on the method signature and the XML annotation. This is 
 * effectively where a method is classified as either a getter or a
 * setter method within an object. In order to determine the type of
 * method the method name is checked to see if it is prefixed with
 * either the "get", "is", or "set" tokens.
 * <p>
 * Once the method is determined to be a Java Bean method according 
 * to conventions the method signature is validated. If the method
 * signature does not follow a return type with no arguments for the
 * get method, and a single argument for the set method then this
 * will throw an exception.
