/**
 * The <code>ModelAssembler</code> is used to assemble the model
 * using registrations based on the specified order. The order of
 * elements and attributes is specified by an <code>Order</code>
 * annotation. For order, all attributes within an XPath expression
 * must be valid attribute references, for example
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    some[1]/path/@attribute
 *    path/to/@attribute
 *    attribute    
 * 
 * </pre>
 * The above expressions are all legal references. The final 
 * reference specifies an attribute that is not within an XPath
 * expression. If the '@' character is missing from attribute
 * orderings an exception is thrown to indicate this.
