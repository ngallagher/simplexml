/**

 * values to an from string representations, which will be inserted
 * in the the generated XML document as the value place holder. The
 * value must be readable and writable in the same format. Fields
 * and methods annotated with the XML attribute annotation will use
 * this to persist and retrieve the value to an from the XML source.

 * </pre>
 * As well as the XML attribute values using transforms, fields and

 * Aside from the obvious difference, the element annotation has an
 * advantage over the attribute annotation in that it can maintain
 * any references using the <code>CycleStrategy</code> object.
