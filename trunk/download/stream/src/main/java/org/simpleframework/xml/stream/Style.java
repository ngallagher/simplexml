/**
 * The <code>Style</code> interface is used to represent an XML style
 * that can be applied to a serialized object. A style can be used to
 * modify the element and attribute names for the generated document.
 * Styles can be used to generate hyphenated or camel case XML.
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &lt;example-element&gt;
 *        &lt;child-element example-attribute='example'&gt;
 *           &lt;inner-element&gt;example&lt;/inner-element&gt;
 *        &lt;/child-element&gt;
 *     &lt;/example-element&gt;
 *     
 * </pre>
 * Above the hyphenated XML elements and attributes can be generated
 * from a style implementation. Styles enable the same objects to be
 * serialized in different ways, generating different styles of XML
 * without having to modify the class schema for that object.
