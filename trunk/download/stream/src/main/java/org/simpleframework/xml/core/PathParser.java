/**
 * The <code>PathParser</code> object is used to parse XPath paths.
 * This will parse a subset of the XPath expression syntax, such
 * that the path can be used to identify and navigate various XML
 * structures. Example paths that this can parse are as follows.
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    ./example/path
 *    ./example[2]/path/
 *    example/path
 *    example/path/@attribute
 *    ./path/@attribute 
 *    
 * </pre>
 * If the parsed path does not match an XPath expression similar to
 * the above then an exception is thrown. Once parsed the segments
 * of the path can be used to traverse data structures modelled on
 * an XML document or fragment.
