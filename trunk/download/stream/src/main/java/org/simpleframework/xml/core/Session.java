/**
 * The <code>Session</code> object represents a session with name
 * value pairs. The persister uses this to allow objects to add
 * or remove name value pairs to an from an internal map. This is
 * done so that the deserialized objects can set template values
 * as well as share information. In particular this is useful for
 * any <code>Strategy</code> implementation as it allows it so
 * store persistence state during the persistence process.
 * <p>
 * Another important reason for the session map is that it is
 * used to wrap the map that is handed to objects during callback
 * methods. This opens the possibility for those objects to grab
 * a reference to the map, which will cause problems for any of
 * the strategy implementations that wanted to use the session
 * reference for weakly storing persistence artifacts.
