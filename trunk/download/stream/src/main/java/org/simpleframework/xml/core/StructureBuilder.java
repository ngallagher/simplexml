/**
 * The <code>StructureBuilder</code> object is used to build the XML
 * structure of an annotated class. Once all the information scanned
 * from the class has been collected a <code>Structure</code> object
 * can be built using this object. The structure instance will 
 * contain relevant information regarding the class schema.
 * <p>
 * This builder exposes several methods, which are invoked in a
 * sequence by the <code>Scanner</code> object. In particular there
 * is a <code>process</code> method which is used to consume the
 * annotated fields and methods. With the annotations it then builds
 * the underlying structure representing the class schema.
