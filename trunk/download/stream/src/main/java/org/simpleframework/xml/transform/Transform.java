/**
 * A <code>Transform</code> represents a an object used to transform
 * an object to and from a string value. This is typically used when
 * either an <code>Attribute</code> or <code>Element</code> annotation
 * is used to mark the field of a type that does not contain any of
 * the XML annotations, and so does not represent an XML structure.
 * For example take the following annotation.
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &#64;Text
 *    private Date date;
 *    
 * </pre> 
 * The above annotation marks an object from the Java class libraries
 * which does not contain any XML annotations. During serialization
 * and deserialization of such types a transform is used to process
 * the object such that it can be written and read to and from XML.
