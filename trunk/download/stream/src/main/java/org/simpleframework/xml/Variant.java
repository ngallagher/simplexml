/**
 * The <code>Variant</code> annotation is used to describe a field or
 * method that can have a number of different XML schemas depending
 * on an XML element name of the instance type. This provides a means
 * of expressing a logical OR. By annotating a field or method as a
 * variant it can take multiple forms. For example.
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &#64;Variant({
 *       &#64;Element(name="circle", type=Circle.class),
 *       &#64;Element(name="square", type=Square.class)       
 *    })
 *    private Shape shape;
 *    
 * </pre>
 * For the above definition the <code>Shape</code> field can take
 * be any of the declared types. On deserialization the name of the
 * element will determine the type that is instantiated and the XML
 * structure to be consumed. For serialization the instance type will
 * determine the name of the element the object will serialized as. 
 * This provides a useful means of consume more complicated sources.
