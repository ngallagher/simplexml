/**
 * The <code>PrimitiveList</code> object is used to convert an element
 * list to a collection of element entries. This in effect performs a 
 * serialization and deserialization of primitive entry elements for 
 * the collection object. On serialization each objects type must be 
 * checked against the XML annotation entry so that it is serialized
 * in a form that can be deserialized. 
 * <pre>
 *
 *    &lt;list&gt;
 *       &lt;entry&gt;example one&lt;/entry&gt;
 *       &lt;entry&gt;example two&lt;/entry&gt;
 *       &lt;entry&gt;example three&lt;/entry&gt;
 *       &lt;entry&gt;example four&lt;/entry&gt;
 *    &lt;/list&gt;
 * 
 * </pre>
 * For the above XML element list the element <code>entry</code> is
 * used to wrap the primitive string value. This wrapping XML element 
 * is configurable and defaults to the lower case string for the name
 * of the class it represents. So, for example, if the primitive type
 * is an <code>int</code> the enclosing element will be called int.
