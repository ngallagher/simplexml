/**
 * The <code>CompositeList</code> object is used to convert an element
 * list to a collection of element entries. This in effect performs a 
 * root serialization and deserialization of entry elements for the
 * collection object. On serialization each objects type must be 
 * checked against the XML annotation entry so that it is serialized
 * in a form that can be deserialized. 
 * <pre>
 *
 *    &lt;list&gt;
 *       &lt;entry attribute="value"&gt;
 *          &lt;text&gt;example text value&lt;/text&gt;
 *       &lt;/entry&gt;
 *       &lt;entry attribute="demo"&gt;
 *          &lt;text&gt;some other example&lt;/text&gt;
 *       &lt;/entry&gt;
 *    &lt;/list&gt;
 * 
 * </pre>
 * For the above XML element list the element <code>entry</code> is
 * contained within the list. Each entry element is thus deserialized
 * as a root element and then inserted into the list. This enables
 * lists to be composed from XML documents. For serialization the
 * reverse is done, each element taken from the collection is written
 * as a root element to the owning element to create the list. 
 * Entry objects do not need to be of the same type.
