/**
 * The <code>ElementList</code> annotation represents a method or
 * field that is a <code>Collection</code> for storing elements. The
 * collection object deserialized is typically of the same type as
 * the field. However, a <code>class</code> attribute can be used to
 * override the field type, however the type must be assignable.
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &lt;list class="java.util.ArrayList"&gt;
 *       &lt;element name="one"/&gt;
 *       &lt;element name="two"/&gt;
 *       &lt;element name="three"/&gt;  
 *    &lt;/list&gt;
 * 
 * </pre>
 * If a <code>class</code> attribute is not provided and the type or
 * the field or method is abstract, a suitable match is searched for 
 * from the collections available from the Java collections framework.
 * This annotation can also compose an inline list of XML elements. 
 * An inline list contains no parent or containing element.
 * <pre>
 *
 *    &lt;element name="one"/&gt;
 *    &lt;element name="two"/&gt;
 *    &lt;element name="three"/&gt;  
 * 
 * </pre>
 * The above XML is an example of the output for an inline list of
 * XML elements. In such a list the annotated field or method must
 * not be given a name. Instead the name is acquired from the name of
 * the entry type. For example if the <code>type</code> attribute of
 * this was set to an object <code>example.Entry</code> then the name 
 * of the element list would be taken as the root name of the object
 * as taken from the <code>Root</code> annotation for that object.
