/**
 * The <code>Serializer</code> interface is used to represent objects
 * that can serialize and deserialize objects to an from XML. This 
 * exposes several <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> methods
 * that can read from and write to various sources. Typically an
 * object will be read from an XML file and written to some other 
 * file or stream. 
 * <p>
 * An implementation of the <code>Serializer</code> interface is free
 * to use any desired XML parsing framework. If a framework other 
 * than the Java streaming API for XML is required then it should be
 * wrapped within the <code>org.simpleframework.xml.stream</code> API,
 * which offers a framework neutral facade.
