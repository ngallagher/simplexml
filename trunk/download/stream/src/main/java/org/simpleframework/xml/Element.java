/**
 * The <code>Element</code> annotation is used to represent a field
 * or method that appears as an XML element. Fields or methods that
 * are annotated with this can be either primitive or compound, that
 * is, represent an object that can be serialized and deserialized.
 * Below is an example of the serialized format for a compond object.
 * <p>
 * If this annotates a type that contains no XML annotations then
 * this will look for a suitable <code>Transform</code> for the type
 * using the <code>Transformer</code>. For instance, all primitives 
 * and primitive arrays that are annotated with this will make use 
 * of a transform in order to convert its value to and from suitable 
 * XML representations.
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &lt;example class="demo.Example"&gt;
 *       &lt;data/&gt;
 *    &lt;example&gt;
 * 
 * </pre>
 * Each element may have any number of attributes and sub-elements
 * representing fields or methods of that compound object. Attribute
 * and element names can be acquired from the annotation or, if the
 * annotation does not explicitly declare a name, it is taken from
 * the annotated field or method. There are exceptions in some cases,
 * for example, the <code>class</code> attribute is reserved by the
 * serialization framework to represent the serialized type.
