<h2>Streaming API for XML</h2>
<p>
This package provides an implementation of the XML serialization framework that makes use of
the Streaming API for XML (StAX). It provides a lighter, leaner, more performant implementation
that the Document Object Model (DOM) implementation. For Java 6 the framework has no external
dependancies and is completely self contained. For Java 5 two external JAR files are required,
the StAX API and the StAX implementation, both are provided with the download.
