<p>
In this example constructor injection is performed on two elements which also have
<a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/Path.html">Path</a> annotations. As can 
be seen if there is no ambiguity there is no need to specify the path annotations on the constructor. This 
reduces the clutter that can occur with excessive annotations.

The below snippet shows an example of the resulting XML, both the x and y values will be injected
in to the annotated constructor.
