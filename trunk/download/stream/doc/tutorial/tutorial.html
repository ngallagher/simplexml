This page provides a tutorial that will prepare users for using XML serialization. Before
this tutorial is attempted it is advisable to have a look at the <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc">Javadoc</a>
documentation for the framework. Although there are only several annotations and objects involved in 
the serialization process the framework itself has many powerful features which this tutorial attempts to 
describe.
