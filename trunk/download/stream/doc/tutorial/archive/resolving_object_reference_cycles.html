<p>
When there are cycles in your object graph this can lead to recursive serialization. However it
is possible to resolve these references using a stock strategy. The 
<a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/graph/CycleStrategy.html">CycleStrategy</a> maintains
the object graph during serialization and deserialization such that cyclical references can be traced
and resolved. For example take the following object relationships.
</p>
<pre class="sh_java">
@Root
public class Parent {

   private Collection&lt;Child&gt; children;

   private String name;

   @Attribute
   public String getName() {
      return name;                   
   }

   @Attribute
   public void setName(String name) {
      this.name = name;           
   }

   @Element
   public void setChildren(Collection&lt;Child&gt; children) {
      this.children = children;           
   }
    
   @Element   
   public Collection&lt;Child&gt; getChildren() {
      return children;           
   }        

   public void addChild(Child child) {
      children.add(child);           
   }
}

@Root
public class Child {

   private Parent parent;

   private String name;

   public Child() {
      super();           
   }

   public Child(Parent parent) {
      this.parent = parent;           
   }

   @Attribute
   public String getName() {
      return name;           
   }

   @Attribute
   public void setName(String name) {
      this.name = name;           
   }

   @Element
   public Parent getParent() {
      return parent;
   }

   @Element
   public void setParent(Parent parent) {
      this.parent = parent;
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
In the above code snippet the cyclic relation ship between the parent and child can be seen. A parent can have
multiple children and a child can have a reference to its parent. This can cause problems for some XML binding
and serialization frameworks. However this form of object relationship can be handled seamlessly using the 
<a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/graph/CycleStrategy.html">CycleStrategy</a> object. Below is an 
example of what a resulting XML document might look like.
</p>
<pre class="sh_xml">
&lt;parent name=&quot;john&quot; id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
   &lt;children&gt;
      &lt;child id="2" name=&quot;tom&quot;&gt;
         &lt;parent ref=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/child&gt;
      &lt;child id="3" name=&quot;dick&quot;&gt;
         &lt;parent ref=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/child&gt;
      &lt;child id="4" name=&quot;harry&quot;&gt;
         &lt;parent ref=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/child&gt;
   &lt;/children&gt;
&lt;/parent&gt;
</pre>
<p>
As can be seen there are two extra attributes present, the id attribute and the ref attribute. These references
are inserted into the serialized XML document when the object is persisted. They allow object relationships and
references to be recreated during deserialization. To further clarify take the following code snippet which shows
how to create a persister that can handle such references.
</p>
<pre class="sh_java">
Strategy strategy = new CycleStrategy("id", "ref");
Serializer serializer = new Persister(strategy);
File source = new File("example.xml");
Parent parent = serializer.read(Parent.class, source);
</pre>
<p>
The strategy is created by specifying the identity attribute as id and the refering attribute as ref. For convinience
these attributes have reasonable defaults and the no argument constructor can be used to create the strategy. Although
the example shown here is very simple the cycle strategy is capable of serializing and deserializing large and complex
relationships.
