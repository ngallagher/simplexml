<a name='callback'></a><b>Receiving persister callbacks</b>
<p>
Of critical importance to the serialization and deserialization process is that the objects
have some control or participation in the process. It is no good to have the persister 
deserialize the object tree from an XML document only to see that the data is not valid or
that further data structures need to be created in many of the deserialized objects. 
To allow objects to participate in the deserialization process two annotations can be used,
these are the <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/core/Validate.html">Validate</a> and
<a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/core/Commit.html">Commit</a> annotations. 
</p>
<p>Both are
involved in the deserialization process (not the serialization process) and are called 
immediately after an object has been deserialized. Validation is performed first, and if the
deserialized object contains a method annotated with the validate annotation it is invoked. 
This allows the object to perform validation of its fields, if the object requirements are
met the method returns quietly, if they are not met the object can throw an exception to
terminate the deserialization process. The commit method is invoked in much the same way, 
the persister looks for a method marked with the commit annotation, if one exists it is
invoked. However, unlike the validate method the commit method is typically used to build
further data structures, for example hash tables or trees. Below is an example of an 
object making use of these annotations.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
@Root
public class PropertyMap {

   private Map&lt;String, Property&gt; map;

   @ElementList
   private List&lt;Property&gt; list;

   public PropertyMap() {
      this.map = new HashMap&lt;String, Entry&gt;();
   }

   @Validate
   public void validate() {
      List&lt;String&gt; keys = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();

      for(Property entry : list) {
         String key = entry.getKey();

         if(keys.contains(key)) {
            throw new PersistenceException("Duplicate key %s", key);
         }
         keys.put(key);         
      }      
   }

   @Commit
   public void build() {
      for(Property entry : list) {
         insert(entry);
      }     
   }

   public void insert(Property entry) {
      map.put(entry.getName(), entry);      
   }  

   public String getProperty(String name) {
      return map.get(name).getValue();
   }
}
</pre>
The above object deserializes a list of property objects into a list. Once the property 
objects have been deserialized they are validated by checking that an entry with a specific
key exists only once. After the validation process has completed the commit method is
invoked by the persister, here the object uses the deserialized property object to build
a hash table containing the property values keyed via the property key. Below is how
the above object would be represented as an XML document.
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;properties&gt;
   &lt;list&gt;
      &lt;entry key="one"&gt;
         &lt;value&gt;first value&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/entry&gt;
      &lt;entry key="two"&gt;
         &lt;value&gt;first value&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/entry&gt;
      &lt;entry key="three"&gt;
         &lt;value&gt;first value&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/entry&gt;
   &lt;/list&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;
</pre>
As well as annotations involved in the deserialization process there are annotations that can
be used to receive persister callbacks for the serialization process. Two annotations can
be used, they are the <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/core/Persist.html">Persist</a> 
and <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/core/Complete.html">Complete</a> methods. 
To receive persister callbacks the methods must be no argument methods marked with the 
appropriate annotations.
</p>
<p>
The persist method is invoked before the serialization of the object. This allows the object
to prepare in some implementation specific way for the serialization process. This method
may throw an exception to terminate the serialization process. Once serialization has 
completed the complete method is invoked. This allows the object to revert to its previous
state, that is, to undo what the persist method has done. Below is an example of how
these annotations can be used. 
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
@Root
public class MailMessage {
   
   @Attribute
   private Stirng format;

   @Element
   private String encoded;

   private byte[] content;

   private Encoder encoder;

   public MailMessage() {
      this.encoder = new Encoder();
   }

   public void setEncoding(String format) {
      this.format = format;
   }

   public String getEncoding() {
      return format;
   }

   public void setMessage(byte[] content) {
      this.content = content;
   }

   public byte[] getMessage() {
      return content;
   }

   @Commit
   public void commit() {
      decoded = encoder.decode(encoded, format);
      encoded = null;
   }

   @Persist
   public void prepare() {
      encoded = encoder.encode(decoded, format);      
   }

   @Complete
   public void release() {
      encoded = null;
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
The above example illustrates how the persist and complete methods can be used in a
scenario where the serialization process needs to encode a byte array into a specific
encoding format. Before the object is persisted the persistable field is set to an
encoded string. When serialization has completed the encoded value is nulled to free
the memory it holds. This example is somewhat contrived however it effectively 
demonstrates how the annotations can be used. Below is an example of what the XML 
document should look like.

<p>
For the above XML message the contents can be serialized and deserialized safely
using persister callbacks. The object can prepare itself before serialization
by encoding the contents of the message to the encoding format specified. Once it has
been encoded and serialized any resources created for serialization can be released.
