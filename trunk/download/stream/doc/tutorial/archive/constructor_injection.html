All but the simplest of programs will have some form of immutable objects. These are objects that 
do not have setters and so will acquire data by using constructor injection. In this manner the
object sets its internal state from the data provided to the constructor. This can also be achieved
with serialization, if you would like to serialize and deserialize objects but do not want to 
provide setter methods this can be done, as illustrated in the example below.

<pre class="prettyprint">
@Root
public class OrderManager {

    private final List&lt;Order&gt; orders;

    public OrderManager(@ElementList(name="orders") List&lt;Order&gt; orders) {
        this.orders = orders;
    }

    @ElementList(name="orders")
    public List&lt;Order&gt; getOrders() {
        return orders;
    }
}

@Root
public class Order {

    @Attribute(name="name")
    private final String name;

    @Element(name="product")
    private final String product;

    public Order(@Attribute(name="name") String name, @Element(name="product") String product) {
        this.product = product;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getProduct() {
        return product;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
The above code illustrates an order manager that contains a list of immutable order
objects. On deserialization the values are taken from the XML document and injected
in to the constructor to instantiate the object. This is a very useful feature that 
is not often found in serialization frameworks. One restriction on the constructor
injection is that it must be used with an annotated get method or field. This is required
so that on serialization the persister knows where to get the data to write. Taking
the above example if the <code>getOrders</code> method was not annotated then there
would be no way to determine how to write the order manager object. 
Below is some example XML resulting from serialization of the order manager.

&lt;orderManager&gt;
    &lt;order name=&quot;AX101&quot;&gt;
        &lt;product&gt;Product A&lt;/product&gt;
    &lt;/order&gt;
    &lt;order name=&quot;AX102&quot;&gt;
        &lt;product&gt;Product B&lt;/product&gt;
    &lt;/order&gt;
    &lt;order name=&quot;AX103&quot;&gt;
        &lt;product&gt;Product C&lt;/product&gt;
    &lt;/order&gt;
&lt;/orderManager&gt;
