<a name='nested'></a><b>Nested object serialization</b>
<p>
As well as simple object serialization, nested object serialization is possible. This is where a serializable object can contain
any number of serializable objects, to any depth. Take the example shown in the code snippet below. This shows several objects
that are linked together to form a single serializable entity. Here the root configuration object contains a server object, which
in turn contains a security information object.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
@Root
public class Configuration {

   @Element
   private Server server;

   @Attribute
   private int id;

   public int getIdentity() {
      return id;
   }

   public Server getServer() {
      return server;           
   }
}

public class Server {

   @Attribute
   private int port;

   @Element
   private String host;

   @Element
   private Security security;

   public int getPort() {
      return port;           
   }

   public String getHost() {
      return host;           
   }

   public Security getSecurity() {
      return security;           
   }
}

public class Security {

   @Attribute
   private boolean ssl;

   @Element
   private String keyStore;

   public boolean isSSL() {
      return ssl;           
   }

   public String getKeyStore() {
      return keyStore;           
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
In order to create an initialized configuration object an XML document can be used. This XML document needs to 
match the XML annotations for the object graph. So taking the above class schema the XML document would look
like the following example.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;configuration id="1234"&gt;
   &lt;server port="80"&gt;
      &lt;host&gt;www.domain.com&lt;/host&gt;
      &lt;security ssl="true"&gt;
         &lt;keyStore&gt;example keystore&lt;/keyStore&gt;
      &lt;/security&gt;
   &lt;/server&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre>
<p>
How the mapping is done can be seen by examining the XML document elements and attributes and comparing these
to the annotations within the schema classes. The mapping is quite simple and can be picked up and understood 
in several minutes.
