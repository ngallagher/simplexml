Taking the above example object the XML deserialization process is described in the code snippet shown below. As can be seen the 
deserialization process is just as simple. The persister is given the class representing the serialized object and the source
of the XML document. To deserialize the object the read method is used, which produces an instance of the annotated object. Also,
note that there is no need to cast the return value from the read method as the method is generic.

Serializer serializer = new Persister();
File source = new File("example.xml");

Example example = serializer.read(Example.class, source);
