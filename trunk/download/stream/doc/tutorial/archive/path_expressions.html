At times it is useful to have your object model map to complex XML documents, without having to write an
annotated class to map to the required elements and attributes. For such scenarios the 
<a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/Path.html">Path</a> annotation can be 
used. This requires the user to specify an XPath expression for a field or method. For example take annotated
fields below.
</p>
<pre class="sh_java">
@Root
public class ServerDeployment {

   @Attribute
   @Path("group")
   private ServerType type;

   @Element
   @Path("group/server[1]/details")
   private Server primary;

   @Element
   @Path("group/server[2]/details")
   private Server secondary;
    
   public Server getPrimary() {
      return primary;
   }

   public Server getSecondary() {
      return secondary;
   }
}

@Root
public class Server {

   @Attribute
   private String host;

   @Attribute
   private int port;
}

public enum ServerType {
   WINDOWS,
   LINUX,
   SOLARIS
}
</pre>
<p>
The above code shows annotations applied to two objects. One contains XPath expressions that
tell the serialization process how to read and write the details to an from the document. Here
the expression defines a server within wrapper elements. When serializing such objects, the 
following XML results.  
</p>
<pre class="sh_xml">
&lt;serverDeployment&gt;
   &lt;group type="LINUX"&gt;
      &lt;server&gt;
         &lt;details&gt;
            &lt;primary host="host1.domain.com" port="4567"/&gt; 
         &lt;/details&gt;
      &lt;/server&gt;
      &lt;server&gt;
         &lt;details&gt;
            &lt;secondary host="host2.domain.com" port="4567"/&gt; 
         &lt;/details&gt;
      &lt;/server&gt;
   &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/serverDeployment&gt;
</pre>
<p>
As can be seen the XPath expressions defined have been used to determine the structure
of the XML document. Such expressions allow a complex XML format to be serialized in to
two simple objects. This can greatly reduce the number of types required to map an
object to an XML structure. Both attributes and elements can be mapped in this manner.
</p>
When ordering elements with the <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/Order.html">Order</a>
annotation these wrapper elements can be sorted. To order wrapper elements an XPath expression can be
used to identify the wrapper. Simply place the expression in the order annotation along with
any element or attribute names and it is ordered as required. For example, take the following
code snippet.
</p>
<pre class="sh_java">
@Default
@Order(elements={"name[1]/first", "name[1]/surname", "age/date", "name[2]/nickname"})
public class Person {
   
   @Path("name[1]")
   private String first;

   @Path("name[1]")
   private String surname;

   @Path("name[2]")
   private String nickname;

   @Path("age")
   private String date;

   public String getName() {
      return first;
   }

   public String getSurname() {
      return surname;
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
Just like ordering of elements or attributes without XPath expressions, a reference is all
that is needed to ensure order. For the above code the serialization of the object will result
in the following XML.
</p>
<pre class="sh_xml">
&lt;person&gt;
   &lt;name&gt;
      &lt;first&gt;Jack&lt;/first&gt;
      &lt;surname&gt;Daniels&lt;/surname&gt;
   &lt;/name&gt;
   &lt;age&gt;
       &lt;birth&gt;19/10/1912&lt;/birth&gt;
   &lt;/age&gt;
   &lt;name&gt;
      &lt;nickname&gt;JD&lt;/nickname&gt;
   &lt;/name&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;
</pre>
<p>
In the above XML snippet we have serialized a single object in to multiple elements and
ensured the order of the elements is as we required. Ordering can be applied to elements
and attributes with <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/Path.html">Path</a>
annotations as easily as it can to those without, and both can be mixed within the same 
annotation. Using this type of ordering it is possible to generate very predictible
results. One thing to note when using such annotations, is that only a subset of the XPath
expression syntax is supported. For example, element and attribute references can not
be taken from the root of the document, only references within the current context are
allowed.
