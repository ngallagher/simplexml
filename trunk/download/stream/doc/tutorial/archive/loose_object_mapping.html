An important feature for any XML tool is the ability to sift through the source XML to find particular
XML attributes an elements of interest. It would not be very convinient if you had to write an object
that accurately mapped every attribute an element in an XML document if all you are interested in is
perhaps an element and several attributes. Take the following XML document.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;contact id='71' version='1.0'&gt;
   &lt;name&gt;
      &lt;first&gt;Niall&lt;/first&gt;
      &lt;surname&gt;Gallagher&lt;/surname&gt;
   &lt;/name&gt;
   &lt;address&gt;
      &lt;house&gt;House 33&lt;/house&gt;
      &lt;street&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/street&gt;
      &lt;city&gt;City&lt;/city&gt;
   &lt;/address&gt;
   &lt;phone&gt;
      &lt;mobile&gt;123456789&lt;/mobile&gt;
      &lt;home&gt;987654321&lt;/home&gt;
   &lt;/phone&gt;
&lt;/example&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
If my object only required the some of the details of the specified contact, for example the phone
contacts and the name then it needs to be able to ignore the address details safely. The following
code shows how this can be done by setting strict to false within the <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/Root.html">Root</a>
annotation.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
@Root(strict=false)
public class Contact {

   @Element
   private Name name;

   @Element
   private Phone phone;

   public String getName() {
      return name.first;
   }

   public String getSurname() {
      return name.surname;
   }

   public String getMobilePhone() {
      return phone.mobile;
   }

   public String getHomePhone() {
      return phone.home;
   }

   @Root
   private static class Name {
    
      @Element
      private String first;

      @Element
      private String surname;
   }

   @Root
   private static class Phone {

      @Element(required=false)
      private String mobile;

      @Element
      private String home;
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
The above object can be used to parse the contact XML source. This simple ignores any XML elements or attributes that do not appear
in the class schema. To further clarify the implementation of loose mappings take the example shown below. This shows how the entry 
object is deserialized from the above document, which is contained within a file. Once deserialized the object values can be examined.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
Serializer serializer = new Persister();
File source = new File("contact.xml");
Contact contact = serializer.read(Contact.class, source);

assert contact.getName().equals("Niall");
assert contact.getSurname().equals("Gallagher");
assert contact.getMobilePhone().equals("123456789");
assert contact.getHomePhone().equals("987654321");
</pre>
<p>
Should there be more than a single object that requires loose mapping then using the 
<a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/Root.html">Root</a> annotation
might not be the ideal solution. In such a scenario the persister itself can be asked to perform loose mapping. Simply pass a boolean to the
read method indicating the type of mapping required. By default the persister uses strict mapping, which can be overridden on an object by
object basis using the <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/Root.html">Root</a> annotation, as shown in the above example. 
However, this default
can be overridden as can be seen in the code snippet below.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
Contact contact = serializer.read(Contact.class, source, false);
</pre>
<p>
Here the boolean passed to the overridden read method tells the serializer to perform a loose mapping. There is no need to specify
anything in the annotations, the serializer will simply map every object loosely. This can be a much more convenient way to 
perform loose mapping, as you only need to annotate your objects with the elements or attributes you are interested in, all other
elements and attributes will be ignored during deserialization. Such a solution is best suited to external XML documents where your
annotated objects do not define the schema.
