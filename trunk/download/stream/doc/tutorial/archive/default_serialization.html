<a name='default'></a><b>Default object serialization</b>
<p>
If an object grows large it often becomes tedious to annotate each field or method that needs to be serialized. In such
scenarios the <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/Default.html">Default</a> annotation can be
used. This will apply default annotations to either the fields or methods of an object that is to be serialized. To 
specify whether it is the fields or methods that will have default annotations, the <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/DefaultType.html">DefaultType</a> enumeration can be used. Take the code snippet below, this shows
two objects with default annotations, one that will apply defaults to the object fields, and one that will apply
defaults to the Java Bean methods of the object.
</p>  
<pre class="prettyprint">
@Root
@Default(DefaultType.FIELD)
public class OrderItem {

   private Customer customer;

   private String name;

   @Attribute
   private double price;

   @Transient
   private String category;

   public String getName() {
      return name;
   }   

   public Customer getCustomer() {
      return customer;
   }
}

@Root
@Default(DefaultType.PROPERTY)
private class Customer {

   private String name;

   private String address;

   public String getName() {
      return name;
   }

   public void setName(String name) {
      this.name = name;
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
In the above object the <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/Transient.html">Transient</a> 
annotation is used to specify that even though default annotations should be applied to the objects fields, the field
annotated as transient should not be serialized. Below is the XML that could be produced using the above classes, notice
that if defaults apply to Java Bean methods, the fields will not be defaulted, instead they will be ignored.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;orderItem price='10.99'&gt;
    &lt;customer&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Elvis Presley&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;/customer&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;IRT452&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;/orderItem&gt;
</pre>
<p>
From the above XML it is obvious, that defaults apply to only those fields or methods requested. If a field or 
method already has an annotation, that is the annotation that is used. If a field or method is to be omitted from
serialization then it can be marked as transient. Applying defaults to an object, can often lead to a cleaner
object structure, and makes it much easier to make objects serializable.
