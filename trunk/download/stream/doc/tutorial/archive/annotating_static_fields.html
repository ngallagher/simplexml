<p>
Often there is a need to add elements and attributes to an XML document that do not change. In such 
an event it is often attractive to declare these fields as static final fields. When annotating 
static final fields they form part of the XML schema and contribute to the validation of the document
but do not get set when deserializing the XML in to a object instance. So should a required static
final field not exist in the source XML then an exception is thrown when deserializing, much like what
would happen if the field was mutable. For example take the code snippet below, which shows an immutable
static final field used with mutable fields.

<pre class="prettyprint">
@Root
public class Citation {

   @Element(name="author")
   private static final String AUTHOR = "Niall Gallagher";

   @Element
   private String title;
   
   @Element   
   private String date;

   public Date getDate() {
      return date;
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
The above annotated object describes a simple citation. The citation object itself contains a static final field that
will be written to the resulting XML document when serialized. However, on deserialization the values read from the XML will not change the annotated
final static field. Instead the deserialization process will simply validate the presence of the elements and attributes within the document. This results in 
an object that will always write the same value for the annotated final static elements or attributes.

   &lt;title&gt;Simple XML Serialization&lt;/author&gt;
   &lt;date&gt;12 January 2010&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;/citation&gt;
