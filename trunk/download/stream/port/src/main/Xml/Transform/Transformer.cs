/// The <c>Transformer</c> object is used to convert strings to
/// and from object instances. This is used during the serialization
/// and deserialization process to transform types from the Java class
/// libraries, as well as other types which do not contain XML schema
/// annotations. Typically this will be used to transform primitive
/// types to and from strings, such as <c>int</c> values.
/// </code>
///    &#64;Element
///    private String[] value;
/// </code>
/// For example taking the above value the array of strings needs to
/// be converted in to a single string value that can be inserted in
/// to the element in such a way that in can be read later. In this
/// case the serialized value of the string array would be as follows.
/// </code>
///    &lt;value&gt;one, two, three&lt;/value&gt;
/// </code>
/// Here each non-null string is inserted in to a comma separated
/// list of values, which can later be deserialized. Just to note the
/// above array could be annotated with <c>ElementList</c> just
/// as easily, in which case each entry would have its own element.
/// The choice of which annotation to use is up to the developer. A
/// more obvious benefit to transformations like this can be seen for
/// values annotated with the <c>Attribute</c> annotation.
