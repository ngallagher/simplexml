   /// The <c>Resolve</c> method is used to resolve an object that
   /// has been deserialized from the XML document. This is used when the
   /// deserialized object whats to provide a substitute to itself within
   /// the object graph. This is particularly useful when an object is
   /// used to reference an external XML document, as it allows that XML
   /// document to be deserialized in to a new object instance.
   /// <p>
   /// This is similar to the <c>readResolve</c> method used within
   /// Java Object Serialization in that it is used to create a object to
   /// plug in to the object graph after it has been fully deserialized.
   /// Care should be taken when using this annotation as the object that
   /// is returned from the resolve method must match the field type such
   /// that the resolved object is an assignable substitute.
