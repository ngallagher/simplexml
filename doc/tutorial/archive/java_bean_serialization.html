<a name='javabean'></a><b>Java Bean serialization</b>
<p>
Although field based serialization offers a simple and efficient means for serializing and deserializing
an object it can often be benificial to use Java Bean getters and setters to read and write values. In 
particular annotating Java Bean setter and getter methods will allow for a cleaner means to override
the serialization behaviour than using fields. It also allows for processing and validation to be performed
as the object is being deserialized. Below is an example of how to annotate an objects methods for 
use in the serialization process, this example mixes annotated fields with annotated methods.

@Root
public class Message {

   private Collection&lt;Entry&gt; list;
         
   @Attribute
   private float version;        

   @ElementList
   public void setList(Collection&lt;Entry&gt; entry) {
      if(entry.isEmpty()) {
         throw new IllegalArgumentException("Empty collection");              
      }
      this.entry = entry;           
   }        

   @ElementList
   public Collection&lt;Entry&gt; getList() {
      return entry;           
   }
}

@Root
public class Entry {

   @Attribute
   public String name;    

   public String text;   

   @Text
   public String getText() {
      return text;           
   }

   @Text
   public void setText(String text){
      this.text = text;           
   }
   
   public String getName() {
      return name;           
   }
}

In the above code the message class will have its methods invoked when a list of entry objects is
encountered. Here the method can perform some form of validation when the list of entry objects
is deserialized. Such validation can also be peformed using the persister callback methods, which is
described in a later section. The requirements for Java Bean method serialization are that 
both the setter and getter must be annotated with the same annotation, and both annotations must
contain identical attributes. The object class schema could produce the following XML document.

<pre>
&lt;message version=&quot;1.2&quot;&gt;
   &lt;list&gt;
      &lt;entry name=&quot;a&quot;&gt;Example text one&lt;/entry&gt;
      &lt;entry name=&quot;b&quot;&gt;Example text two&lt;/entry&gt;
   &lt;/list&gt;
&lt;/message&gt;
