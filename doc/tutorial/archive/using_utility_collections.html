<a name='util'></a><b>Using utility collections</b>
<p>
For convinience there are several convinience collections which can be used. These collections only need to be
annotated with the <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/ElementList.html">ElementList</a> annotation
to be used. The first stock collection resembles a map in that it will accept values that have a known
key or name object, it is the <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/util/Dictionary.html">Dictionary</a> collection.
This collection requires objects of type  <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/util/Entry.html">Entry</a> to 
be inserted on deserialization as this object contains a known key value. To illustrate how to use this collection take the
following example.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
@Root
public class TextMap {
   
   @ElementList(inline=true)
   private Dictionary&lt;Text&gt; list;   

   public Text get(String name) {
      return list.get(name);           
   }
}

@Root
public class Text extends Entry {

   @Text          
   public String text;

   public String getText() {
      return text;           
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
The above objects show how the dictionary collection is annotated with the element list annotation. The containing
object can not serialize and deserialize entry objects which can be retrieve by name. For example take the 
following XML which shows the serialized representation of the text map object.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;textMap&gt;
   &lt;text name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Niall Gallagher&lt;/text&gt;
   &lt;text name=&quot;street&quot;&gt;Seasme Street&lt;/text&gt;
   &lt;text name=&quot;city&quot;&gt;Atlantis&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/textMap&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Each text entry deserialized in to the dictionary can now be acquired by name. Although this offers a convinient
map like structure of acquring objects based on a name there is often a need to match objects. For such a requirement
the <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/util/Resolver.html">Resolver</a> collection can be used. This
offers a fast pattern matching collection that matches names or keys to patterns. Patterns are deserialized within
<a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/util/Match.html">Match</a> objects, which are inserted in to the
resolver on deserialization. An example of the resolver is shown below.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
@Root
private static class ContentType extends Match {

   @Attribute
   private String value;        

   public ContentType() {
      super();                  
   }

   public ContentType(String pattern, String value) {
      this.pattern = pattern;
      this.value = value;        
   }
}
   
@Root
private static class ContentResolver implements Iterable<ContentType> {

   @ElementList
   private Resolver&lt;ContentType&gt; list;           

   @Attribute
   private String name;

   public Iterator&lt;ContentType&gt; iterator() {
      return list.iterator();
   }

   public ContentType resolve(String name) {
      return list.resolve(name);              
   }
}   
</pre>
<p>
The above content resolver will match a string with a content type. Such an arrangement could be used to resolve
paths to content types. For example the following XML document illustrates how the resolver could be used
to match URL paths to content types for a web application.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;contentResolver name='example'&gt;
   &lt;contentType pattern='*.html' value='text/html'/&gt;
   &lt;contentType pattern='*.jpg' value='image/jpeg'/&gt;
   &lt;contentType pattern='/images/*' value='image/jpeg'/&gt;
   &lt;contentType pattern='/log/**' value='text/plain'/&gt;
   &lt;contentType pattern='*.exe' value='application/octetstream'/&gt;
   &lt;contentType pattern='**.txt' value='text/plain'/&gt;
   &lt;contentType pattern='/html/*' value='text/html'/&gt;
&lt;/contentResolver&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Although the resolver collection can only deal with wild card characters such as * and ? it is much faster than
resolutions performed using Java regular expressions. Typically it is several orders of magnitude faster that
regular expressions, particularly when it is used to match reoccuring values, such as URI paths.
