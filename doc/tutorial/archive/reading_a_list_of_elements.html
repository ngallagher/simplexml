<a name='list'></a><b>Reading a list of elements</b>
<p>
In XML configuration and in Java objects there is often a one to many relationship from a parent to
a child object. In order to support this common relationship an <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/ElementList.html">ElementList</a> annotation has been 
provided. This allows an annotated schema class to be used as an entry to a Java collection object.
Take the example shown below.
</p>
<pre class="brush: java;">
@Root
public class PropertyList {

   @ElementList
   private List&lt;Entry&gt; list;

   @Attribute
   private String name;

   public String getName() {
      return name;
   }

   public List getProperties() {
      return list;
   }
}

@Root
public class Entry {

   @Attribute
   private String key;

   @Element
   private String value;

   public String getName() {
      return name;
   }

   public String getValue() {
      return value;
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
From the above code snippet the element list annotation can be seen. The field type is reflectively instantiated
as a matching concrete object from the Java collections framework, typically it is an array list, but can be
any collection object if the field type declaration provides a concrete implementation type rather than the
abstract list type shown in the above example.
</p>
<p>
Below an XML document is shown that matches the schema class. Here each entry element will be deserialized
using the declared entry class and inserted into the collection instance created. Once all entry objects have
been deserialized the object instance contains a collection containing individual property objects.
</p>
<pre class="brush: xml;">
&lt;propertyList name="example"&gt;
   &lt;list&gt;
      &lt;entry key="one"&gt;
         &lt;value&gt;first value&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/entry&gt;
      &lt;entry key="two"&gt;
         &lt;value&gt;first value&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/entry&gt;
      &lt;entry key="three"&gt;
         &lt;value&gt;first value&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/entry&gt;
      &lt;entry key="four"&gt;
         &lt;value&gt;first value&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/entry&gt;
   &lt;/list&gt;
&lt;/propertyList&gt;
</pre>
<p>
From the above example it can be seen that the entry details are taken from the generic type of the collection.
It declares a list with the entry class as its generic parameter. This type of declaration is often not possible,
for example if a specialized list contains more than one generic type which one is the correct type to use for
deserialization or serialization. In such scenarios the type must be provided explicitly. Take the following example.
</p>
<pre class="brush: java;">
@Root
public class ExampleList {

   @ElementList(type=C.class)
   private SpecialList&lt;A, B, C&gt; list;

   public SpecialList&lt;A, B, C&gt; getSpecialList() {
      return list;
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
In the above example the special list takes three generic parameters, however only one is used as the generic parameter
for the collection. As can be seen an explicit declaration of which type to use is required. This can be done with the
type attribute of the <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/ElementList.html">ElementList</a> annotation.
