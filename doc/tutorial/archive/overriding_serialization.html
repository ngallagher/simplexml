<p>
Often times there is a need to serialize an object that can not be annotated. Such objects may
exist in third party dependencies or packages. To serialize these objects a 
<a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/convert/Converter.html">Converter</a> 
object can be implemented. A converter can be used to intercept the normal serialization process.
Interception of the normal serialization process can be done in several different ways, for
example take the code snippet below.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
@Root
public class Example {

   @Element
   @Convert(ExternalConverter.class)
   private External external;
    
   public External getExternal() {
      return external;
   }
}

public class ExternalConverter implements Converter&lt;External&gt; {

   public External read(InputNode node) {
      String name = node.getAttribute("name");
      String value = node.getAttribute("value");

      return new External(name, value);
   }

   public void write(OutputNode node, External external) {
      String name = external.getName();
      String value = external.getValue();

      node.setAttribute("name", name);
      node.setAttribute("value", value);
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
The above code snippet also shows a field annotated with the 
<a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/convert/Convert.html">Convert</a> 
annotation. The converter specified by the annotation will be used to intercept the 
normal serialization process and produce a customized XML element. Take the XML below,
this is produced when the example object is serialized.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;example&gt;
    &lt;external name=&quot;book&quot; value=&quot;Shantaram&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/example&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Interception of the normal serialization process is performed using a
<a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/strategy/Strategy.html">Strategy</a>
implementation and so does not form part of the core serialization process. Instead
a specific strategy needs to be provided to the persister as is shown in the code snippet below. 
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
Strategy strategy = new AnnotationStrategy();
Serializer serializer = new Persister(strategy);

serializer.read(Example.class, file);
</pre>
<p>
Without the specification of the <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/convert/AnnotationStrategy.html">AnnotationStrategy</a>
the interception could not be performed, as the core serialization process will not acknowledge the 
<a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/convert/Convert.html">Convert</a> annotation.
So in effect this strategy extends the core serialization process in an independent and transparent manner.
Another even more transparent way to intercept the normal serialization process is to use another
strategy implementation. The <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/convert/RegistryStrategy.html">RegistryStrategy</a>
allows bindings to be registered between classes and converters, there is no need for additional annotations as 
was required for the previous example. Below is an example of how to establish bindings between a class and
a converter.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
Registry registry = new Registry();
Strategy strategy = new RegistryStrategy(registry);
Serializer serializer = new Persister(strategy);

registry.bind(External.class, ExternalConverter.class);
</pre> 
<p>
As many bindings as is required can be established with a registry. Also, if more complex converters
are required a converter instance can be registered. Such a converter could have a reference to 
the <a href="/download/stream/doc/javadoc/org/simpleframework/xml/core/Persister.html">Persister</a> 
object so that nested serialization can be performed. This registry strategy also ensures that objects
within Java collection objects can be serialized with registered converters. To illustrate how a
complex converter could be registered take a look at the snippet below.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
Registry registry = new Registry();
Strategy strategy = new RegistryStrategy(registry);
Serializer serializer = new Persister(strategy);
ComplexConverter converter = new ComplexConverter(serializer);

registry.bind(ComplexObject.class, converter);
</pre>
