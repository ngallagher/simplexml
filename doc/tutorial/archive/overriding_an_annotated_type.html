<a name='override'></a><b>Overriding an annotated type</b>
<p>
In order to accommodate dynamic types within the deserialization process a class attribute can be added to an
XML element, which will ensure that that element can be instantiated as the declared type. This ensures that
field and method types can reference abstract classes and interfaces, it also allows multiple types to be added into 
an annotated collection.
</p>
<pre>
package example.demo;

public interface Task {

   public double execute();
}

@Root
public class Example implements Task {

   @Element
   private Task task;

   public double execute() {
      return task.execute();
   }  
}

public class DivideTask implements Task {

   @Element(name="left")
   private float text;

   @Element(name="right")
   private float right;

   public double execute() {
      return left / right;
   }
}

public class MultiplyTask implements Task {

   @Element(name="first")
   private int first;

   @Element(name="second")
   private int second;

   public double execute() {
      return first * second;
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
The class attribute must be a fully qualified class name so that the context class loader can load
it. Also, the type can contain its own unique annotations and types which makes the deserialization 
and serialization process truly dynamic. Below is an example XML document declaring the class 
type for the task object.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;example&gt;
   &lt;task class="example.demo.DivideTask"&gt;
      &lt;left&gt;16.5&lt;/left&gt;
      &lt;right&gt;4.1&lt;/right&gt;
   &lt;/task&gt;
&lt;/example&gt;  
</pre>
<p>
In order to execute the task described in the XML document the following code can be used. Here it is
assumed the XML source is contained within a file. Once the example object has been deserialized 
the task can be executed and the result acquired.
</p>
<pre>
Serializer serializer = new Persister();
File example = new File("example.xml");
Example example = serializer.read(Example.class, example)

double value = example.execute();
</pre>
