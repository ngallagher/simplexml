/**
 * Provides a set of transforms used to transform Java primitive types.
 * Transforms are used to convert primitive types in to strings that
 * can be used within an XML document. For example, take the Java date
 * object <code>java.util.Date</code>, this can be converted in to a
 * date string usable within an XML attribute or in an XML element text
 * value. Other types can also be transformed such as Java enums and
 * primitives and if desired custom transforms can be implemented.
